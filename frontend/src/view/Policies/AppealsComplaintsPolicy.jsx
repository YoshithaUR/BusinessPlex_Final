            Businessplex is committed to ensuring that all student complaints are resolved fairly, promptly and at the most appropriate level within the Institute. A strong complaints policy, and the recording of the number of complaints received and resolved, assist in ensuring continuous improvement of the quality of services to our customers.
          </div>
          <div className='pb-5'>
            The Complaints Policy and its procedures are designed to achieve the following goals:
          </div>
          <div className='pb-5'>
            To provide a procedure that recognises the right of a customer to make a complaint and which is focussed on continuous quality improvement.
            To provide procedures for addressing and resolving customer complaints speedily, in accordance with principles of natural justice, in a confidential manner and with the involvement of all those about whom complaints are made.
          </div>
          <div className='pb-5'>
            To provide for prompt resolution at the level at which most complaints are likely to arise while providing for independent mediation and conciliation should the matter not be resolved at the first level.
          </div>
          <div className='pb-5'>
            To encourage all staff to process improvements where necessary to remove the possibility of repetition of similar complaints.

            The Complaints policy and procedures will complement, but not replace, existing Institute policies and procedures for dealing with other forms of grievances, and or cancellations, assessment appeals, discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment or criminal acts. Complaints that are found to be outside the domain of this policy will be directed to the appropriate channels.

    content: (
      <div>
        <p>
          <div className='pb-5'>
            All complaints are treated with appropriate confidentiality, unless to do so would compromise the Instituteâ€™s duty of care. Similarly, people who are themselves the subject of a complaint, have the right to expect that any claims made against them are treated confidentially.
          </div>

          <div className='pb-5'>
            While confidentiality can be assured, anonymity cannot. It will be sometimes impossible to guarantee that a complainant will not be identified, particularly if the circumstances of their complaint are unique. Anonymity is not appropriate if formal processes are invoked. When a formal complaint is lodged the person(s) who is the subject of the complaint will be notified and provided with details of the allegation(s).
          </div>

          <div className='pb-5'>
            The CEO will retain records of the types of issues that are the subject of complaints, the timeliness of response and the nature of the resolution. This information will be reviewed and used to ensure and enhance continuous quality improvement.

          Students are encouraged, wherever possible to resolve concerns or difficulties directly with the person(s) involved to deal with the issue before it becomes a formal complaint. The CEO, Administration Manager and other staff are available to assist students to resolve their issues at this level. Where a complaint cannot be resolved informally by discussion and mediation, a formal complaint may be lodged with the CEO.
