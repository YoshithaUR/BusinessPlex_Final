                <p>Generally, people may elect to not provide Businessplex with personal information. However, much of the personal information collected by Businessplex is necessary to provide people with training services or access to government support. Without this information, Businessplex may be restricted in its ability to provide these services or support. In some cases, enrolment at Businessplex will not be possible without certain information provided. How personal information is collected and held Businessplex will only collect personal information by lawful and fair means. Businessplex will generally collect personal information from people directly, unless: they consent to the collection of the information from someone else; or Businessplex is required or authorised by, or under, an Australian law, or a court/tribunal order, to collect the information from someone else; or it is unreasonable or impracticable to get the information from the person directly. Businessplex stores personal information in both electronic and hard copy forms and must comply with government legislation and regulation with regards to this storage.</p>
